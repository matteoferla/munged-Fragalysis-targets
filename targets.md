CFIm contributes to the recruitment of multiprotein complexes on specific sequences on the pre-mRNA 3'-end, so called cleavage and polyadenylation signals (pA signals) (PubMed:9659921, PubMed:8626397, PubMed:14690600, PubMed:17024186). Most pre-mRNAs contain multiple pA signals, resulting in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) producing mRNAs with variable 3'-end formation (PubMed:17098938, PubMed:23187700, PubMed:29276085). The CFIm complex acts as a key regulator of cleavage and polyadenylation site choice during APA through its binding to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) for a huge number of pre-mRNAs (PubMed:17098938, PubMed:20695905, PubMed:29276085). NUDT21/CPSF5 activates indirectly the mRNA 3'-processing machinery by recruiting CPSF6 and/or CPSF7 (PubMed:29276085). Binds to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized upstream of pA signals that act as enhancers of pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (PubMed:8626397, PubMed:14690600, PubMed:15169763, PubMed:17024186, PubMed:22813749, PubMed:20479262). The homodimer mediates simultaneous sequence-specific recognition of two 5'-UGUA-3' elements within the pre-mRNA (PubMed:20479262, PubMed:21295486). Plays a role in somatic cell fate transitions and pluripotency by regulating widespread changes in gene expression through an APA-dependent function (By similarity). Binds to chromatin (By similarity).

In absence of diphosphate, hydrolyzes with similar activities various modified nucleoside diphosphates such as ADP-ribose, ADP-mannose, ADP-glucose, 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-dGDP (PubMed:10567213, PubMed:10722730, PubMed:19699693, PubMed:21389046, PubMed:17052728). Can also hydrolyze other nucleotide sugars with low activity (PubMed:19699693, PubMed:21389046). In presence of diphosphate, mediates the synthesis of ATP in the nucleus by catalyzing the conversion of ADP-ribose to ATP and ribose 5-phosphate. Nuclear ATP synthesis takes place when dephosphorylated at Thr-45 (PubMed:27257257). Nuclear ATP generation is required for extensive chromatin remodeling events that are energy-consuming (PubMed:27257257). Does not play a role in U8 snoRNA decapping activity (By similarity).

In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses such as secretory processes, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, epithelial cell polarization, neurons adhesion, migration and differentiation, and growth-factor induced formation of membrane ruffles. Rac1 p21/rho GDI heterodimer is the active component of the cytosolic factor sigma 1, which is involved in stimulation of the NADPH oxidase activity in macrophages. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. Stimulates PKN2 kinase activity. In concert with RAB7A, plays a role in regulating the formation of RBs (ruffled borders) in osteoclasts. In podocytes, promotes nuclear shuttling of NR3C2; this modulation is required for a proper kidney functioning. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation (By similarity). In neurons, is involved in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). In hippocampal neurons, involved in spine morphogenesis and synapse formation, through local activation at synapses by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as ARHGEF6/ARHGEF7/PIX (By similarity). In synapses, seems to mediate the regulation of F-actin cluster formation performed by SHANK3 (By similarity). In neurons, plays a crucial role in regulating GABA(A) receptor synaptic stability and hence GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission through its role in PAK1 activation and eventually F-actin stabilization (By similarity)',)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ('Interacts with NISCH.
